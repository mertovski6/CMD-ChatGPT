# Python Chatbot with OpenAI's GPT-3

This is a simple Python chatbot application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate responses to user input.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, you need to have an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup/). Once you have an API key, you should set it as an environment variable with the name `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

You also need to have the `openai` Python library installed. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install openai
```

## Usage

To run the chatbot, simply run the `chatbot.py` script:

```
python chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will prompt you for input and respond with generated text from the GPT-3 model.

You can customize the chatbot by modifying the `chat` function in the `chatbot.py` script. The function takes the following parameters:

- `prompt`: The user's input as a string.
- `model`: The GPT-3 model to use, e.g. "text-davinci-002".
- `temperature`: Controls the "creativity" of the generated text. Higher values result in more creative responses.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens (words) to generate in the response.
- `top_p`: The maximum probability of selecting a candidate response.
- `frequency_penalty`: The amount of penalty to apply to tokens that have been recently generated. Higher values result in less repetition in the generated text.
- `presence_penalty`: The amount of penalty to apply to tokens that have been generated in the prompt. Higher values result in more novelty in the generated text.

You can adjust these parameters to fine-tune the chatbot's behavior.

This chatbot application is for educational purposes only. The responses generated by the GPT-3 model are not guaranteed to be accurate or appropriate in all situations. Use at your own risk.
